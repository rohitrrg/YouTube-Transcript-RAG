# YouTube Transcript RAG System

* Developed a YouTube Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, FAISS, and Hugging
Face models to enable context-aware Q&A over video transcripts.
* Integrated Mistral-7B (4-bit quantized) and Gemma-3 1B for efficient inference, optimizing GPU/CPU usage with
bitsandbytes and caching strategies.
* Built an interactive Streamlit interface for transcript indexing, retrieval, and real-time question answering.
* Containerized the application with Docker for reproducible deployment on local and cloud environments.
